# Machine_Learning_Project
Project made for recruitment process.

Project contains 3 task:

1) Machine learning algorithm that will predict the prices of cars.
2) Script for checking number of correct password in the file.
3) Script which generates a RGB picture of chessboard, using python libraries - NumPy and Matplotlib.

Task num.1 was made in jupyter notebook. It contains data preperation, plotting data and attempts to implement machine learning model. Creating the model is not completed.

In data preparation process the irrelevant columns and duplicates were dropped. Also the the records with price smaller than 750 and greater than 350000 were dropped. 

In data visualization part the correlation between all parameters of db were shown on the plot.

In the attempt of implementing the model, following parameters were included:
- price
- year
- condition
- fuel
- odometer
- transmission

Tasks number 2 and 3 were completed.
